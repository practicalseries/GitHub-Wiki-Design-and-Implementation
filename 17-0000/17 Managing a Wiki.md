This section covers various points about managing and maintaining a Wiki. This is from the point of view of using a text editor on local machine to modify the Wiki. 

In particular, using Visual Studio Code (<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>) as the text editor for the Wiki and then using the facilities of VS Code to push any modifications to GitHub.

This section covers the following:

## 17.1<!--     üü•H2üü•--><img width="081" height="1" src="https://psop.uk/wi-s" alt="Spacer">Revision control

*Here we go then.*

A Wiki is a *(restricted)* repository in its own right (see <a href="01-introducing-the-github-wiki#14the-wiki-is-its-own-repository">section&nbsp;1.4</a>). It is restricted because GitHub doesn‚Äôt give all the facilities available to a normal repository to a Wiki, you cannot, for example, have branches within a Wiki repository (GitHub just ignores them and only works with the Master branch).

Now, when you clone a repository to a local machine (see <a href="02-cloning-a-wiki">section&nbsp;2</a>) and open it in some Git friendly text editor (<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> for example) you get the full facilities available for managing any repository and you can apply them all to the Wiki &mdash; you can, for example,  create branches within the Wiki and push them back to GitHub, only to have GitHub ignore them completely.

So, while you have all the facilities to manage the Wiki as a full-blown repository, it is best to scale down your ambitions and just use those facilities that GitHub wants you to 

*So here‚Äôs my guide:*

Don‚Äôt think of the Wiki as a development environment where you can create branches, assign them to different development teams and merge everything back together at some later date.

<p align="center"> ${\huge \color{#C00000}\text{Think\ of\ a\ Wiki\ as\ a\ document\ that\ only\ one\ person\ can\ work\ on\ at\ a\ time.}}$ </p>

**Each time the document is changed and reposted to GitHub, the document revision is updated.**

Obviously, more than one person can clone the Wiki and each person can modify bits of it as they like, but there is no structure (like branches) that allows for different development paths or group working. Essentially, you would have to incorporate everybody else‚Äôs changes into your cloned copy before pushing your own changes back to GitHub. *It‚Äôs a bit of a nightmare.*

The best mechanism for managing a Wiki that I‚Äôve come up with, is to have a single person controlling the Wiki, let‚Äôs call them the *‚ÄúLead‚Äù* (in my case, it is me). 

That person sets up the underlying folder structure and pushes the result to GitHub.

If someone else wants to work on the Wiki, the Lead sets up a new folder in the structure and assigns it to that person, that person can work in that folder (add, delete, change files &c.), but only in that folder (no other part of the Wiki). 

This process is repeated for each person working on the Wiki, the each get their own folder.

When an individual changes a file in their folder and wants to push it to GitHub to test it, they must first pull any other changes made to the Wiki to their local machine. Since all these changes will have been made in other folders (allocated to other people), there will be no impact on the local modified files. The whole lot can then be pushed back to GitHub.

Where common files or files in directories outside an individual‚Äôs development folder, these must be managed by the Lead.

### 17.1.1<!--  üü•H3üü•--><img width="074" height="1" src="https://psop.uk/wi-s" alt="Spacer">Managing commits

When I first started writing a Wiki, I was meticulous about commit messages *(as I am with a proper repository)*, it rapidly dawned on me that this was a pointless exercise.

This is a screen shot of part of my modification history for this Wiki:

<table name="f-17-01" align="center"><!-- FIGURE STARTüîΩüîΩ(BLANK LINE ABOVE) -->
<!-- Figure row --> <tr><td>
<!-- LINK -->         <a href="./17-0000/02-images/figm-17-01.png" title="Use ctrl+click to open image in new tab">

</table>                             <!-- FIGURE END  üîºüîº(BLANK LINE BELOW) -->

There are pages of it. At the time of writing I‚Äôd made 2,229 commits to the Wiki and they all had the same commit message:

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;üöß Wiki construction ‚Äî initial development

While you are developing a Wiki, there is absolutely no point in trying to record changes or manage the revisions in anyway. Think how many changes you make to a Word document, spelling mistakes, changing an image, updating the contents and links, not to mention incorporating comments from other people.

There are thousands of changes and not much point in trying to explain each one, at best you enter commit message such as: *‚Äútypographical corrections‚Äù, ‚Äúincorporated comments from MG‚Äù* &c. Such commit messages do not impart much information. 

The only useful information for previous commits is the date of the commit. Along the lines of: *‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure that section was OK last Tuesday, let‚Äôs load that one and see what I screwed up in the meantime‚Äù*.

It‚Äôs different once the Wiki is complete, reviewed and published. At that point, changes will be fewer and probably associated with a revision of a particular section &c. Under these circumstances more meaningful commits may be a practical option.

**Until then don‚Äôt worry about commit messages.**

In VS Code, with Source Control active, there is a list of the most recent commits in the left-pane. If you right-click one of these messages you can copy the commit message and just paste it into the commit box at the top and then commit the changes. It's an easy way to re-use the same commit message.

## 17.2<!--     üü•H2üü•--><img width="077" height="1" src="https://psop.uk/wi-s" alt="Spacer">Finding the first Wiki commit

GitHub can display the history of any Wiki page (this was discussed in <a href="01-introducing-the-github-wiki#141viewing-a-wiki-page-history">section&nbsp;1.4.1</a>). Broadly, go to the Wiki page you want to see the history of and click the revisions link (this is in the title area of the page, just below the title text).

This is the current history for the Home page of this repository:

<table name="f-17-02" align="center"><!-- FIGURE STARTüîΩüîΩ(BLANK LINE ABOVE) -->
<!-- Figure row --> <tr><td>
<!-- LINK -->         <a href="./17-0000/02-images/figm-17-02.png" title="Use ctrl+click to open image in new tab">
<!-- FIGURE -->         <img width="850" src="./17-0000/02-images/figm-17-02.png" alt="Wiki page revision">
                    </a></td></tr>
<!-- CAPTION -->    <tr><th align="center"><sup>
<!-- CAPTION TEXT -->   Figure 17.2 &mdash; Wiki page revision
                    </sup></th></tr>
</table>                             <!-- FIGURE END  üîºüîº(BLANK LINE BELOW) -->


As was said in <a href="01-introducing-the-github-wiki#141viewing-a-wiki-page-history">section&nbsp;1.4.1</a>, this history isn‚Äôt particularly useful, for a start you cannot see the complete history for the whole Wiki, just a page at a time.

The only practical use for the GitHub Wiki history is for finding the first commit number for the Wiki. This is only needed if you rebase the Wiki to get rid of all the commits that accrue in the creation process (this is discussed in detail in the next section).

To find the first commit for the repository, go to the Home page of the Wiki and click the revisions link at the top-left of the page to open the history page (shown above).

Scroll to the bottom of the page and keep clicking Older until you get to the oldest commit:

<table name="f-17-03" align="center"><!-- FIGURE STARTüîΩüîΩ(BLANK LINE ABOVE) -->
<!-- Figure row --> <tr><td>
<!-- LINK -->         <a href="./17-0000/02-images/figm-17-03.png" title="Use ctrl+click to open image in new tab">
<!-- FIGURE -->         <img width="850" src="./17-0000/02-images/figm-17-03.png" alt="Wiki first commit">

<!-- CAPTION -->    <tr><th align="center"><sup>
<!-- CAPTION TEXT -->   Figure 17.3 &mdash; Wiki first commit
                    </sup></th></tr>
</table>                             <!-- FIGURE END  üîºüîº(BLANK LINE BELOW) -->

The first commit for this Wiki is `dd06e43`. 

This is the easiest way to find the first commit number for the Wiki (the home page is the first page to be created when starting the Wiki).

*You may be wondering why it important to know the first commit point?*

The answer is: *it isn‚Äôt*, not unless you want to purge all the commits that have been made (apart from the first one) and reload the current state of the pages back in as the second commit point (I.e. to essentially reset the repository and remove all the many commits that have been made in the meantime).

I discuss this process in the next section.

## 17.3<!--     üü•H2üü•--><img width="077" height="1" src="https://psop.uk/wi-s" alt="Spacer">Rebasing the Wiki

**Rebasing scares the shit out of most people, no one really understands it and if you get it wrong you can lose all your stuff.**

I have a golden rule about rebase: ${\huge \color{#C00000}\text{Never\ use\ rebase.}}$ 

*So why do I want to use it?*

*Well*, what I‚Äôm describing here breaks most of the rules about version control and repositories, but it can be used to tidy up all those unwanted commits in a Wiki.

Let‚Äôs say you find yourself in the position that I‚Äôm in: I‚Äôve finished the Wiki and I want to publish it to GitHub, but I‚Äôve got 2000+ commits from developing, testing, correcting &c. and I don‚Äôt want any of them. Essentially, what I want is for the finished version to be the first (or more practically, the second) commit.

In short, I don‚Äôt want all the intervening commits for every spelling correction and minor document tweak that was made. I want to go from the initial commit (when the Wiki was created) to the finished article.


 ${\huge \color{#C00000}\text{Yep,\ it\ breaks\ the\ basic\ rule\ of\ a\ version\ control\ system.}}$

My thought process was this: I‚Äôm never going to wade through 2000 commit point looking for a particular change, so what‚Äôs the point in having them. Surely it is better to get rid of all those commits and start with the finished article. I can then monitor the commits from there on, these being more relevant, smaller in scope and more traceable.

***That said, this process is brutal and is not for the faint hearted. I would practice it on a development Wiki that you don‚Äôt care about first.***

I.e. all the intervening commits are gone and the Wiki is back in the same state as it was at the final commit before all this started

## 17.4<!--     üü•H2üü•--><img width="076" height="1" src="https://psop.uk/wi-s" alt="Spacer">Wikis and search engine visibility

This is a confusing topic and I‚Äôm not clear what the situation is. 

Currently, search engines are allowed to craw GitHub Wiki files, at least they are not excluded in the GitHub.com `robots.txt` file:

<table name="t-cc-01" align="center"><!-- TABLE STARTüîΩüîΩ(BLANK LINE ABOVE) -->
<!-- HEADER ROW --> <tr>
                        <th colspan="2"">GitHub: robots.txt file</th>

<!-- DATA ROW -->   <tr>

That said, the GitHub documentations (<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis">here</a>) says the following:

‚ÄúSearch engines will only index wikis with 500 or more stars that you configure to prevent public editing.‚Äù
I don‚Äôt have 500 stars, so I can‚Äôt tell if this is true

*‚ÄúSearch engines will only index wikis with 500 or more stars that you configure to prevent public editing.‚Äù*

I don‚Äôt have 500 stars, so I can‚Äôt tell if this is true

I‚Äôve also noted that when I‚Äôve searched for things in the process of writing this, GitHub Wikis tend not to come up in the search results.

Either way, if your Wiki is configured for public editing (see <a href="01-introducing-the-github-wiki#f-01-03">here</a>) it won‚Äôt feature in 

To turn this off, click ${\large \color{#00B050}\langle\text{Settings}\rangle}$ for the repository, select ${\large \color{#00B050}\langle\text{General}\rangle}$ in the left-hand menu bar and then in the Features area (main section) tick the ${\large \color{#00B050}\langle\text{Restrict\ editing...}\rangle}$ box:


GitHub Wikis are definitely searchable from the GitHub search box.
